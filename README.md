# Video Influencer Performance Tracking - DeepFace Video Analysis DNN Algorithm

This project is designed to analyze and track the performance of video influencers using deep learning algorithms, specifically a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for video analysis and facial recognition. The tool uses the DeepFace library to process video data, extract facial features, and provide performance insights based on various metrics.

## Features

- **DeepFace Integration**: Utilizes the DeepFace library for accurate facial recognition and analysis.
- **Influencer Performance Tracking**: Tracks video influencers' performance by analyzing facial expressions and engagement metrics.
- **Deep Learning Algorithm**: Implements a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN) for video analysis, ensuring robust and scalable performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the performance of influencers based on video data.
